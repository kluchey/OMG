## Definition

The ideas, statements, or events in any situation that allow us to reason further about the situation. You can think of a *context* as being prior knowledge related to a topic you are now discussing.

## Examples

### Non-Math

My friend bought the new Playstation and the new Call of Duty to play on it. When my friend says "Want to come over to play CoD later?" I know the context:  We will be playing Call of Duty (CoD) and it will be on a Playstation.

### Math

"Given $2\times 3 = 6$" determine two related division facts. In quotes is the "context" of the situation we are now asked to reason further about by giving a solution "Two division facts would be $6\div 3=2$ and $6\div 2=3$" because we know $2$ and $3$ are a pair of [[Factor|factors]] of 6.
