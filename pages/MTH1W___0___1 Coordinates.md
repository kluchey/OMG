- ## Learning Goals
	- Students will be able to describe how **algebra**, through the use of numbers and variables, allows them to describe ==[[direction]]== and ==[relations]([[relation]])== using measurements.
	- Students will be begin to use ==[[computational steps]]== to communicate their mathematical thinking.

		- Hold the place of an unknown measure so that we can use it in instructions or computations before we know its value.
		- Eg. $$ A=l\cdot w $$ where A represents Area, l length, and w width. This formula is a set of instructions for how to calculate the Area of a rectangle without knowing the length, width, and Area (yet).
