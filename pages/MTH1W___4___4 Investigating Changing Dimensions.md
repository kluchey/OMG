  In this investigation, you will learn to ==[prove]([[proof]])== how changing dimensions of a solid will change its ==[[Volume]]== or ==[[Surface Area]]==.

	- For the two problems below, you want to create two very organized solutions that you will modify later.
		- Calculate the ==[[Volume]]== of a rectangular prism with $L=3$cm, $W=2$cm, and $H=4$cm.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Calculate the ==[[Surface Area]]== of the same rectangular prism.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ## Action
	- If the width, $W$, is doubled from $2$ to $4$, can you draw new images for the Volume and Surface Area (net)
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
