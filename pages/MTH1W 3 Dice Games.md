## Slope-Intercept Form
	- Tools required per group (two students):  4 dice, 2 graph whiteboards
	- ### Practice Round (x2)
		- Roll all 4 dice, group dice into pairs, you have just created two points! Make one or more of the dice negative.
		- Label each dice pair as $$A(x_1, y_1)$$ and $$B(x_2, y_2)$$.
		- TODO Calculate the slope between points $$A$$ and $$B$$.
		- TODO Calculate the y-intercept of the line passing through points $$A$$ and $$B$$.
		- End of Round. Repeat this round one more time, for practice.
	- ### Challenge Rounds
		- This game is a Battle Royale. Teams will compete to be the last group standing.
		- Rules:
			- Teams work under a time limit to solve a problem correctly. An incorrect solution does nothing.
			- The first team to solve a problem correctly under the time limit will choose **two** teams to knockout.
			- Teams that are knocked out can re-enter the battle by solving any future problem correctly within the time limit. If a knocked out team have the first correct solution, they get to knockout double, i.e. **four** teams.
			- The game ends when one team is remaining or by reaching the last 5 minutes of class, wherein multiple teams can win the battle. The knocked out teams must call "Winner Winner Chicken Dinner" to congratulate the last remaining team(s).
			- The instruction "Design" means dice can be
		- Rounds:
			- Design the dice such that the largest *slope* and **y-intercept** are found.
			- Roll the dice such that the *slope* is closest to zero.
			- Design the dice such that the *slope* is negative and **y-intercept** is positive.
			- Roll the dice such that the *slope* is negative and **y-intercept** is positive.
			- Design the dice such that both points are negative and the *slope* is positive.
			- Design the dice such that the **y-intercept** is $$(0,1)$$.
			- Roll the dice such that one point is snake eyes $$(1,1)$$ and the slope is positive.
