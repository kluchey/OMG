## Slope-Intercept Form
	- Tools required per group (two students):  4 dice, 2 graph whiteboards, 2 whiteboard markers
	- ### Practice Round (x2)
		- Roll all 4 dice, group dice into pairs, you have just created two points! Make one or more of the dice negative.
		- Label each dice pair as $$A(x_1, y_1)$$ and $$B(x_2, y_2)$$.
		- TODO Calculate the ==[[slope]]== between points $$A$$ and $$B$$.
		- TODO Calculate the ==[[y-intercept]]== of the line passing through points $$A$$ and $$B$$.
		- End of Round. Repeat this round one more time, for practice.

	- ### Battle Royale
		- Teams will compete to be the last group standing.
		- Rules:
			- **Time Limit**:  Teams work under a time limit to solve a problem correctly. In safety rounds, a correct solution will block a team from being knocked out. An incorrect solution does nothing, i.e. it does not trigger the first team rule.
			- **First Team**:  The first team to solve a problem correctly under the time limit will choose **two** teams to knockout.
			- **Zombies**:  Teams that are knocked out can re-enter the battle by solving any future problem correctly within the time limit. If a knocked out team have the first correct solution, they get to knockout double, i.e. **four** teams.
			- **Win Conditions**:  The game ends when one team is remaining or by reaching the last 5 minutes of class, wherein multiple teams can win the battle. The knocked out teams must call "Winner Winner Chicken Dinner" to congratulate the last remaining team(s).
			- **Instructions**:  The instruction "Design" means dice faces can be chosen by the team. The instruction "Roll" means the dice must be rolled at random. "double-double" means multiply the base knockout of 2 by 2 two times, or $$2\times 2\times 2=8$$; "double-double-double" is a thing too.

		- Rounds:
			- Design the dice such that the largest *slope* and **y-intercept** are found. Safety round.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Roll the dice such that the *slope* is closest to zero. **y-intercept** must still be calculated. Safety Round.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Design the dice such that the *slope* is negative and **y-intercept** is positive. Safety Round.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Roll the dice such that the *slope* is negative and **y-intercept** is positive.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Design the dice such that both points are negative and the *slope* is positive. **y-intercept** does not need to be calculated.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Design the dice such that the **y-intercept** is $$(0,1)$$.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Roll the dice such that one point is snake eyes $$(1,1)$$ and the *slope* is positive. The winner of this round gets to knock out double-double, i.e. **eight** teams.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Roll the dice such that the **y-intercept** is $$2$$ and the *slope* is negative. The winner of this round gets to knock out double-double-double, i.e. **sixteen** teams. Usually a $$(\text{double})^3$$ event is winner-take-all.

- ## Intersection of Lines
	- Tools required per group (two students):  6 dice, 2 graph whiteboards, 2 whiteboard markers @@html: <br><br>@@
	- ### Practice Round (x2)
		- Roll all 6 dice, group dice into triples, you have just created two lines! Make one or more of the dice negative. @@html: <br><br>@@
		- In each triple, use 2 dice to represent the ==[[slope]]==:  one die is your rise, one die is your run. Recall that $$m=\frac{rise}{run}$$. Use the third die to represent your ==[[y-intercept]]==. @@html: <br><br>@@
		- TODO Graph both lines on ==[[Cartesian]]== axes with an x-scale of -10 to 10 and a y-scale of -10 to 10. @@html: <br><br>@@
		- TODO Calculate the ==[[point of intersection]]== of the lines by using the method of substitution. Hint:  start with $$y=y$$ now what is your next step? @@html: <br><br>@@
		- End of Round. Repeat this round one more time, for practice.
