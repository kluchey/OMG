## Slope-Intercept Form
	- Tools required per group (two students):  4 dice, 2 graph whiteboards
	- ### Practice Round (x2)
		- Roll all 4 dice, group dice into pairs, you have just created two points! Make one or more of the dice negative.
		- Label each dice pair as $$A(x_1, y_1)$$ and $$B(x_2, y_2)$$.
		- TODO Calculate the slope between points $$A$$ and $$B$$.
		- TODO Calculate the y-intercept of the line passing through points $$A$$ and $$B$$.
		- End of Round. Repeat this round one more time, for practice.

	- ### Challenge Rounds
		- This game is a Battle Royale. Teams will compete to be the last group standing.
		- Rules:
			- **Time Limit**:  Teams work under a time limit to solve a problem correctly. An incorrect solution does nothing but does not trigger the first team rule.
			- **First Team**:  The first team to solve a problem correctly under the time limit will choose **two** teams to knockout.
			- **Zombies**:  Teams that are knocked out can re-enter the battle by solving any future problem correctly within the time limit. If a knocked out team have the first correct solution, they get to knockout double, i.e. **four** teams.
			- **Multi-win**:  The game ends when one team is remaining or by reaching the last 5 minutes of class, wherein multiple teams can win the battle. The knocked out teams must call "Winner Winner Chicken Dinner" to congratulate the last remaining team(s).
			- **Instructions**:  The instruction "Design" means dice faces can be chosen by the team. The instruction "Roll" means the dice must be rolled at random.
		- Rounds:
			- Design the dice such that the largest *slope* and **y-intercept** are found.
			- Roll the dice such that the *slope* is closest to zero. **y-intercept** must still be calculated.
			- Design the dice such that the *slope* is negative and **y-intercept** is positive.
			- Roll the dice such that the *slope* is negative and **y-intercept** is positive.
			- Design the dice such that both points are negative and the *slope* is positive.
			- Design the dice such that the **y-intercept** is $$(0,1)$$.
			- Roll the dice such that one point is snake eyes $$(1,1)$$ and the *slope* is positive. The winner of this round gets to knock out double-double, i.e. **eight** teams.
			- Roll the dice such that the **y-intercept** is $$2$$ and the *slope* is negative. The winner of this round gets to knock out double-double-double, i.e. **sixteen** teams. Usually a $$(\text{double})^3$$ event is winner-take-all.
