## Slope-Intercept Form
	- Tools required per group (two students):  4 dice, 2 graph whiteboards
	- ### Practice Round (x2)
		- Roll all 4 dice, group dice into pairs, you have just created two points! Make one or more of the dice negative.
		- Label each dice pair as $$A(x_1, y_1)$$ and $$B(x_2, y_2)$$.
		- TODO Calculate the slope between points $$A$$ and $$B$$.
		- TODO Calculate the y-intercept of the line passing through points $$A$$ and $$B$$.
