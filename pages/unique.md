- #definition In math, unique means there is only one of this object.
- #eg Fractions are ==[[not]]== unique, since $\frac{3}{6}=\frac{2}{4}=\frac{1}{2}=0.5$.
- #eg If we enforce the rule that a fraction must be written in its lowest terms, such as $\frac{1}{2}$ then there is now only one fraction to represent the number $0.5$ so $\frac{1}{2}$ is now uniquely the lowest terms fraction for $0.5$.
