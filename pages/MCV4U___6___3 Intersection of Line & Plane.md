- #+BEGIN_CAUTION
  In this lesson, we imagine how a plane and a line can interact in three dimensions.

- ## Warm Up
	- Grab a pencil and a piece of paper. How many *different* ways can this paper interact with the pencil? Which object is like a line and which is like a plane in this situation? Summarize all of the ways to interact with sketches.
- ## Action:  Examples #.v-self-border
	- Find the intersection (if any) for each of the following systems in $\R^3$, $k\in \R$ in each.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $\begin{cases}\left(x,y,z\right)=\left(4,6,-2\right)+k\left(-1,2,1\right)\\ 2x-y+6z+14=0\end{cases}$
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $\begin{cases}x=5+k\\ y=4+2k\\ z=7+2k\\ 2x+3y-4z+7=0\end{cases}$
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $\begin{cases}\left(x,y,z\right)=\left(2,14,1\right)+k\left(-1,-1,1\right)\\ 3x-y+2z+6=0\end{cases}$
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ## Consolidation
	- For this consolidation, review the examples you solved in the action. We will let $L$ represent a Line and $P$ represent a Plane.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- If $L$ and $P$ meet at one point of intersection, what do we expect to have found at the end of our algebraic solution?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- If $L$ and $P$ do not intersect, what do we expect to have found at the end of our algebraic solution?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- If $L\subset P$ ($L$ is contained by $P$), what do we expect to have found at the end of our algebraic solution?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Find the intersection of each of the following:
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $\begin{cases}x=-2+k\\ y=1-k\\ z=2+3k\\ x+4y+z-4=0\end{cases}$
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $\begin{cases}\left(x,y,z\right)=\left(-1,3,4\right)+k\left(6,1,-2\right)\\ x+2y\end{cases}$
