- #+BEGIN_CAUTION
  In this lesson, we imagine how a plane and a line can interact in three dimensions.
  #+END_CAUTION
- ## Warm Up
	- Grab a pencil and a piece of paper. How many *different* ways can this paper interact with the pencil? Which object is like a line and which is like a plane in this situation? Summarize all of the ways to interact with sketches.
- ## Action:  Examples #.v-self-border
	- Find the intersection of each of the following, $k\in \R$ in each.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $\begin{cases}\left(x,y,z\right)=\left(4,6,-2\right)+k\left(-1,2,1\right)\\ 2x-y+6z+14\end{cases}$
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $\begin{cases}x=5+k\\ y=4+2k\\ z=7+2k\\ 2x+3y-4z+7=0\end{cases}$
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $\left\lbrace\right\rbrace$
