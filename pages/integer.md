- #definition An integer is a positive or negative ==[[whole number]]==.
	- $\Z = \left\lbrace\ldots,-100,\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\ldots,1000,\ldots\right\rbrace$
	- Depending on your perspective, Zero (0) is both negative and positive or neither negative nor positive.
	- A negative is a ==[[direction]]== relative to 0. Usually, a number line has negatives on the left side so we like to say a negative is the same as the direction left. See ==[[direction]]== for more details.
