- [[2025-05-25]] Math explanations are an art, not always a science. Math explanations should predict where a solver and a reader would mess up their understanding and show those steps specifically.
	- #eg "Do you need me to scan the left or the right?" and a coworker responds "right".
		- Has the coworker meant "Yes, do the left scan?" because they have misunderstood?
		- Or does the person mean "do the right scan"?
		- This example comes from the role of x-ray technologist where communication with a coworker on a requested x-ray needs to be unambiguous. Instead, the question should be reworded so the answer "right" is not ambiguous.
			- The coworker could think about their response more to be unambiguous, however that still needs to be clarified. This is why we need to reword the question.
	- #eg Have you ever had a friend who, when asked a binary question like "Would you like cucumber or onion?" they respond with just "Yes"?
