- #definition Consistent means we can get the same solution in two or more ways.
- #eg We can tell the point $(0,4)$ is on the line $y = 3x + 4$ because we know that the $+4$ on the end is the ==y-intercept== (from MTH1W). We also know that substituting $x=0$ into the equation gives $y=3(0)+4=0+4=4$ which means $x=0$ and $y=4$ and so $(xm(0,4)$ is a point on the line. These
