- #definition Consistent means we can get the same fact or solution in two or more ways using different strategies.
- #eg We can tell the point $(0,4)$ is on the line $y = 3x + 4$ because we know that the $+4$ on the end is the ==y-intercept== (from MTH1W). We also know that substituting $x=0$ into the equation gives
  $$y=3(0)+4=0+4=4$$
  which means $x=0$ and $y=4$ and so $(x,y)=(0,4)$ is a point on the line. These two solutions show that the fact "$(0,4)$ is a point on $y$" is a consistent fact.
