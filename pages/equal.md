- #definiton Equal, as in "Equivalence" or when using the symbol "=" called an "equals sign" is an ==[[operation]]== on two numbers to check if they have *the same* ==[[value]]==.
	- #eg You can think of "=" as asking a question to which the answer will either be `True` or `False`. $4=4$ can be "Is 4 equal to 4?" and the answer is `True`.
	- Whereas, to the question $5=4$ the answer is `False`.
	- More complicated questions can be asked using ==[inequalities]([[inequality]])== which behave very similar to equalities or equations.
