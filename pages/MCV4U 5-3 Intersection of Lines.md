		- a) Find the intersection point of the lines in 2D, where $$t,k\in\R$$,

	- ## Consolidation
		- Create the vector or parametric equations for two parallel, but not ==[[coincident]]==, lines in $$\R^3$$. If you try to solve this system for its ==[parameters]([[parameter]])==, what happens? Will this always happen for two parallel lines?

		- Create the vector or parametric equations for two coincident lines in $$\R^3$$. If you try to solve this system for its parameters, what happens? Will this always happen for two coincident lines?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Create the vector or parametric equations for two ==[[skew]]== lines in $$\R^3$$. If you try to solve this system for its parameters, what happens? Will this always happen for two skew lines?

		- How can you verify that your solution to a system of equations is correct?

		- ### Practice
			- Find the intersection between each line. If the lines do not intersect, state whether the lines are parallel or skew. In each equations, assume $$t,k\in\R$$.
