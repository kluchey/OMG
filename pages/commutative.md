- #definiton An [[operation]] is commutative if and only if the order of the operation does not matter to the result.
- #eg Addition is commutative:  $4+5$ is the same as $5+4$ or $x+y$ is the same as $y+x$.
- #eg Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division are all commutative.
	- $x-y = -y+x$, note that the negative on $y$ is the same as multiplying by $-1$
	- $x\cdot y = y \cdot x$
	- $\frac{x}{y} = \frac{1}{y}\cdot x$, note that dividing is the same a smul
