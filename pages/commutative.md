- #definiton An [[operation]] is commutative if and only if the order of the operation does not matter to the result.
- #eg Addition is commutative:  $4+5$ is the same as $5+4$ or $x+y$ is the same as $y+x$.
- #eg Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division are all commutative so long as the operation is respected.
	- $x-y = -y+x$, note that the negative on $y$ is the same as multiplying by $-1$
	- $x\cdot y = y \cdot x$
	- $x\cdot \frac{1}{y} = \frac{x}{y} = \frac{1}{y}\cdot x$, note that dividing is the same as multiplying by "1 over" the value, in this case "1 over y" or $\frac{1}{y}$.
	- "The operation is respected" only when it also commutes with its operand, eg. $x-y$ is not equal to $y-x$ because the negative did not commute with the operand $y$ as it should. This rule is true for all commutative operations and we will say "Respect the
