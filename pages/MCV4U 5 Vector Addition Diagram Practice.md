	- Complete each problem in the order viewed.
	  ---
	- Draw diagrams for these scenarios.

		- An airplane, $$\vec{p}$$, is flying and there is wind, $$\vec{w}$$. The airplane wants to travel to a location $$[\text{N}8^\circ E]$$ of where it is currently located. Also draw the resultant, $$\vec{r}$$.

		- A person, $$\vec{p}$$, is swimming and there is a current, $$\vec{c}$$. The person wants to travel to a location $$[\text{N}30^\circ E]$$ of where they are currently located. Also draw the resultant, $$\vec{r}$$.

		- A person, $$\vec{p}$$, is swimming and there is a current, $$\vec{c}$$. The person's position is $$[\text{N}40^\circ E]$$ from where their destination is located. Also draw the resultant, $$\vec{r}$$.

		- Compare:  What do all of these problems have in common?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Contrast:  What is different between these problems?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Strategize:  How do we phrase each problem with vectors? Is this a shared strategy or do the strategies differ?

	- i) Draw a graph/diagram and determine a vector equation for these **lines**.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	  ii) Be as *efficient* as possible with your solution; list the number of steps you took to complete each problem.
		- logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  $$y=3x+4$$
		- logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  $$3x-4y+5=0$$
		- logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  $$\text{Let } t\in \R \text{ then } x = 3-4t \text{ and } y=4-3t$$
		- logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  $$\frac{x-4}{3}=\frac{y+3}{-4}$$
		- logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  $$\frac{x-4}{3}=\frac{y+3}{-4}=\frac{z+2}{5}$$
		- This line is ==[[parallel]]== to $$3x-4y+5=0$$ and contains the point $$(3,4)$$.
