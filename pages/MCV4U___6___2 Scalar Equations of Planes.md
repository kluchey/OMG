- #+BEGIN_WARNING
  In this lesson our **goal** is to describe a plane with a scalar equation, i.e. an equation without vectors. We will learn to use Desmos 3D to represent

- ## Recall
	- Given the scalar equation in 2D for a line, what is the normal vector?
		- Use $Ax+By+C=0$ or, #eg $3x-5y-1=0$.
			- **Recall:**
			  collapsed:: true
				- A normal is a vector that is perpendicular to the direction of the line.
				- Given $Ax+By+C=0$ we can get the normal vector by reading off $A$ and $B$. I.e. the normal vector is $\begin{bmatrix}A\\ B\end{bmatrix}$.
				- In the example above, a normal vector is $\begin{bmatrix}3\\ -5\end{bmatrix}$
- ## Lesson
	- The scalar equation of a plane is similar to the one for a line, but has an extra parameter:
		- $$Ax+By+Cz+D=0$$
		- Where $\begin{bmatrix}A\\ B\\ C\end{bmatrix}$ is a normal vector to the plane depicted as $n$ in the diagram below.
