  In this lesson our **goal** is to describe a plane with a scalar equation, i.e. an equation without vectors. We will learn to use Desmos 3D to represent

- ## Recall
	- Given the scalar equation in 2D for a line, what is the normal vector?
		- Use $Ax+By+C=0$ or, #eg $3x-5y-1=0$.
			- **Recall:**
				- A normal is a vector who is perpendicular to the direction of the line.
