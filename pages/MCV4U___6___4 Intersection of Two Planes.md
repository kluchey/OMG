- #+BEGIN_CAUTION
  By the end of this lesson, you will solve a system of equations where the solution is a line.

- ## Forced Recall
	- In what ways can two lines interact in 2D?
	- How have we ==[generalized]([[generalize]])== this idea to 3D so far? Write down everything you know about the ways lines and planes interact in 3D space.
	- What are all the ways **two** planes can interact? What would you expect to find as their intersection?
- ## Action:  Examples
	- Find the intersection (if any) of the planes:
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $3x-2y+z-7=0$
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $2x+4y-2z+12=0$
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Find the intersection (if any) of the planes:
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $x+4y-3z+6=0$
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- $2x+8y-6z+11=0$
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ## Consolidation
	- What are the allowed operations when using elimination? There are **three** but the last is very subtle.
		- Multiply an equation by a constant.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Add or subtract two different equations. Don't accidentally subtract an equation from itself
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Swap the order of equations.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
