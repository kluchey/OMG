- ## Warm Up
	- Let's think about how to translate some English into Algebra, here's an example from EQAO:
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1748396924758_0.png){:height 294, :width 343}
		- *Solution.*
			- By giving Nancy $x$ books, we can discuss Nancy's amount without knowing the number. Let's analyze the next sentences:
			- Braveen has triple the number of books Nancy has, plus 5 more books.
			  collapsed:: true
				- $3x+5$ or $3(x+5)$?
				  collapsed:: true
					- *Answer* is $3x+5$ since the 5 more books is added after the tripling.
			- Cal has double the number of books Braveen has.
				- If Braveen has $3x+5$ what is double?
					- $2(3x+5)$ or $(2)3x+5$?
						- $2(3x+5)=6x+10$ because we need to double the entire amount of books.
	- And here's a question from EQAO in 2024:
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1748394775799_0.png){:height 287, :width 278}
- ## Action
	- This is a question from #EQAO in 2023:
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1748393501044_0.png){:height 250, :width 285}
