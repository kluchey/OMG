- ## Warm Up
	- Let's think about how to translate some English into Algebra, here's an example from EQAO:
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1748396924758_0.png){:height 294, :width 343}
		- *Solution.*
		  collapsed:: true
			- By giving Nancy $x$ books, we can discuss Nancy's amount without knowing the number. Let's analyze the next sentences:
			- Braveen has triple the number of books Nancy has, plus 5 more books.
			  collapsed:: true
				- $3x+5$ or $3(x+5)$?
				  collapsed:: true
					- *Answer* is $3x+5$ since the 5 more books is added after the tripling.
			- Cal has double the number of books Braveen has.
			  collapsed:: true
				- If Braveen has $3x+5$ what is double?
				  collapsed:: true
					- $2(3x+5)$ or $(2)3x+5$?
					  collapsed:: true
						- *Answer.* $2(3x+5)=6x+10$ because we need to double the entire amount of books. The brackets $(\square)$ group Braveen's together into one number we need to calculate first.
			- In total they have 245 books:
			  collapsed:: true
				- Nancy + Braveen + Cal = 245
				  collapsed:: true
					- $x + (3x+5) + 2(3x+5) = 245$
					  collapsed:: true
					  now solve for x.
						- *Answer.* $x=23$
	- Complete this next one on your own. (Unfold the next section to see the rest of this question)
		- Cooper has a weirdly large number of tooth brushes.
		  collapsed:: true
			- If we add 5 more to Cooper's amount and then double it, we get the size of Finn's significantly larger collection of tooth brushes.
			  collapsed:: true
				- Even more impressive is Lucas's collection which is ten times larger minus one tooth brush, which he recently lost in a freak tooth whitening incident.
		- If together, Cooper, Finn, and Lucas have 1305 tooth brushes, how many tooth brushes must Cooper have?
- ## Action
	- Here's a question from #EQAO in 2024. How would you model it using Algebra?
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1748394775799_0.png){:height 287, :width 278}
	- This is a question from #EQAO in 2023. How would you model it using Algebra?
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1748393501044_0.png){:height 250, :width 285}
	- Here's a question from the #EQAO practice test. Can you model this question using Algebra? What else can you use?
		- ![image.png](../assets/image_1748394726186_0.png){:height 350, :width 272}
	- **Compare:**  What do all of these problems have in common?
	- **Contrast:**  What is different about each of these problems?
	- **Strategize:**  How will you approach a problem like this on EQAO? How will you know you received a similar problem?
- ## Consolidation
	- Which problems require **Algebra** to model and which can be modelled with **Number Sense** alone? Solve each problem first and then **categorize** each as needing Algebra or Number Sense.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- To estimate the population of elephants in Kenya, aerial photographs are recorded. It is well known in Kenya that *Maasai Mara* National Reserve has three times more elephants than *Samburu* National Reserve.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- A quarter of all Canadians love Pineapple on Pizza. A tenth of the Pineapple lovers also love Grapes on Pizza. If there are 40.1 million Canadians, how many would eat Grapes and Pineapple on their Pizza?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Solve this Riddle:  A number plus ten, minus four, plus seven is equal to a quarter of its size less eleven.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- A lot of problems on the #EQAO test will require you to model a situation using **Algebra** or **Number Sense** and then solve or simplify.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Describe what **Algebra** means in one sentence, using your own words.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Describe what **Number Sense** means, in one sentence, using your own words.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- What is the difference between Algebra and Number Sense? How are they related to each other?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Exit Ticket:
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- A rectangular room has an Area of $120\text{m}^2$. The length of the room is three times the width. What are the dimensions (length and width) of the room?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Practice:
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- A bakery has prices $5 per donut and $6 per cupcake. In total, they sell $500 worth of donuts and cupcakes in one day. This situation can be modelled by the Algebra:  $5d+6c=500$.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- What are $d$ and $c$ measuring? Write let statements for the variables.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- What does $5d$ calculate? Interpret the meaning of this algebra.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- What does $6c$ calculate? Interpret the meaning of this algebra.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- What does $5d+6c$ mean? Why does it make sense to set it equal to $500?
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- If on this day the bakery sold 40 donuts, how many cupcakes were sold? *Solve an equation to answer this problem.*
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- **Challenge:** Ignore the last part. Instead, what if the bakery knew it sold a combined total of 90 baked goods (cupcakes and donuts combined). Can you make a new equation to model this situation? Can you use your two equations to figure out, specifically, how many donuts and cupcakes were sold?
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Why would a bakery want to model sales using an algebra?
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- You are trying to recreate a very old family favourite recipe for Pizza Dough for Father's Day. Luckily, it was written by your Mathematician Great Aunt and despite a number being worn out, all other measures are based on the missing number. Can you figure out how much yeast is used?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- *missing* grams of Yeast.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Flour:  Eighty times the amount of Yeast.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Water:  The same amount as Flour.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Salt:  Quadruple the amount of Yeast, less 1 gram.
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- In total, weigh your mixture, it should be 494 grams.
