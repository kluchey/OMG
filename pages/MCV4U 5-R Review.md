# Review Problem Set
	- Topic:  Forms of Equations in 3D
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Determine the vector, parametric, and symmetric equations of the line through the points $A(3, -1, 5)$ and $B(-4, 5, -9)$.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Complete this relational graph for the various forms of a line in $\R^3$ by annotating the arrows. Note:Â  Arrows are a short few words to describe the **process(es)** or **step(s) you perform** to go between forms in a specific direction.
