# Review Problem Set
	- Topic:  Forms of Equations in 3D
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Determine the vector, parametric, and symmetric equations of the line through the points $A(3, -1, 5)$ and $B(-4, 5, -9)$.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Complete this relational graph for the various forms of a line in $\R^3$ by annotating the arrows. Note:Â  Arrows are a short few words to describe the **process(es)** or **step(s) you perform** to go between forms in a specific direction.

		- Why is there no scalar equation for a line in $\R^3$? Hint:  {{cloze Can you draw a diagram to help you figure out and describe what problems someone would have forming a scalar equation of a line in 3D?}}

	- Topic:  Points of Intersection in 3D
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Determine the point of intersection for the following system of equations in $\R^3$.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  $$\begin{cases} L_1: & \frac{x-1}{2}=\frac{y+2}{-1}=\frac{z-2}{4} \\ L_2: & \vec{r}(t)=\langle 3,0,-2 \rangle +t\langle -2,-1,6 \rangle \end{cases}$$
		- In his handout, Mr. Cluchey messed up and wrote $\langle -2,-1,-6 \rangle$, introducing an extra negative. Does this new, erroneous system still have a point of intersection or is it skew?
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Determine the point of intersection for the following system of equations in $\R^3$. $$
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  $$\begin{cases} L_3: & \{ x=1-k, 2y=k+1, z=2-2k \} & \text{for }k\in\R \\ L_4: & \langle \frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{4},1 \rangle +t\langle 2,-1,4 \rangle & t\in\R \end{cases}$$
	- Topic:  Making decisions with an ambiguous problem.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- Find the intersection (if any) of the following two lines, if they do not intersect, state whether they are skew or parallel.
