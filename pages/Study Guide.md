# How should I Study Mathematics in High School? A Guide
	- ## Avoid Illusions of Knowing
		- Cramming can produce short-term gains but will be lost in long-term memory, leading to the very common feeling of "hitting a wall you can't climb up" at some future point.
		- Re-reading and highlighting *feel* like they produce results but actually produce very little memorization or understanding. You need to perform other activities while re-reading, such as forced recall and focused practice.
	- ## Science Says...
		- Spaced Repition
			- Space over *dats*
		- Forced Recall
		- Focused Practice
		- REM Sleep
	- ## Examples
	- ## Pro-tips
		- Always get a good night's sleep before a test. Always eat breakfast the morning of a test day.
		- Always keep a calendar and know when the next test will be so you can prepare days before you write it.
		- Always practice with the calculator you will use. Learn your calculator well, it is a tool you need to practice.
		- Always show thinking, even if you think it could be wrong. Don't erase unless you will replace; just cross out lightly.
