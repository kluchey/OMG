		- **Cramming** can produce short-term gains but these gains will be lost in the long-term [^1], leading to the very common feeling of "hitting a wall you can't climb up" at some future, tougher point in a course or in a future school.
		- **Re-reading and highlighting** *feel* like they produce results but actually produce very little memorization or understanding [^1].
		  collapsed:: true
			- During REM sleep your brain will throw away the information reviewed by re-reading and highlighting because this information is noisy [^1].
			- You need to perform other activities while re-reading, such as forced recall and focused practice.
		- The **Game of Telephone**:  Don't rely solely on your memory which fades as days pass. Use notes, research, AI (results may be incorrect), or YouTube to refresh yourself on topics and check your understanding. Otherwise, as memory fades, you might be recalling the wrong concept eventually, like in how the game of telephone each person alters the phrase just slightly by having to remember and whisper to the next person.
	- ## ðŸ§ª Science Says...
		- ### Spaced Repition [^1]
		  collapsed:: true
			- Practice over multiple days to really remember a topic. Repeat concepts you feel confident about **and** concepts that are brand new, easily forgotten, or are challenging.
			- Continue to practice questions from previous units, especially in a subject like math where later units build upon earlier units.
		- ### Forced Recall [^1]
		  collapsed:: true
			- Take at least 2 minutes each day to perform the activity:
				- >>Write down everything you know about $x$ topics you want to be remembered or understood.
			- The act of forcing yourself to remember or recall a concept actually stores a memory in your brain for longer. Think of this task like **strengthening** the connections your brain is forming to remember or understand concepts.
		- ### Focused Practice [^1]
		  id:: 682fe63d-536c-45e1-bc22-12e07e83dff2
		  collapsed:: true
			- Select questions to practice and complete from start to finish with your best abilities shown in knowledge, thinking, communication, and application.
		- #### REM Sleep
		  collapsed:: true
			- A sleep of at least 6-8 hours every night is required by teenagers to get enough REM sleep where your brain stores its most important information for long-term and trashes the unnecessary information.
		- #### Memory Palace Technique [^1]
		  collapsed:: true
			- Humans evolved to remember locations to hunt, gather, and seek safety; text and algebra are not immediately connected to locations but these connections can be made!
			  collapsed:: true
				- Algebra is related to graphing & geometry. Graphing and geometry both describe physical movements or measurements which can be repeated with your hands, feet, or with objects in space. You can do better at remembering and understanding algebra by using ==[[spacial reasoning]]==.
				- A sillier but very legitimate method to remember a lot of information and quickly is to place that information around locations you visit often, such as your house or your room.
				  collapsed:: true
					- #eg On your chair is $y=mx+b$ and the chair's back is the y-axis, or rise, while the seat is the x-axis, or run.
					- $b$ is where your head hits the back when you sit in the chair.
					- You slouch on an angle $m$ where you can measure the change in your height $\Delta y$ per change in your seat $\Delta x$, so your slouch is $m=\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}=\frac{rise}{run}$.
					- Can you picture that more easily than the formulas alone?

		- #### After school routine:
		  collapsed:: true
			- At a minimum, take 2 minutes each evening to do the forced recall activity:
			  collapsed:: true
				- >>Write down everything you know about $x$ topics need to be remembered or understood.
			- Then, take at least 2 minutes to complete some focused practice:
			  collapsed:: true
				- >> Select questions you need to know after today or have needed to know in the past. Complete them from start to finish.
				- In math class, usually we do more focused practice than just 2 minutes and most questions require more than 2 minutes to write down.
			- Then, take 2 minutes to consolidate:
			  collapsed:: true
				- >> What didn't you know in your practice? What do you need to know after today? Add these findings to your forced recall activity.
			- Repeat this routine every day to keep building on top of the knowledge you remembered each day prior.
	- ## ðŸ˜Ž Pro-tips
		- Always get a good night's sleep before a test. Always eat breakfast the morning of a test day.
		- Always keep a calendar and know when the next test will be so you can prepare days before you write it.
		- Always practice with the calculator you will use. Learn your calculator well, it is a tool you need to practice.
		- Always show thinking, even if you think it could be wrong. Don't erase unless you will replace; just cross out lightly.
