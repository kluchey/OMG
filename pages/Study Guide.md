# How should I Study Mathematics in High School? A Guide
	- ## Avoid Illusions of Knowing
		- Cramming can produce short-term gains but will be lost in long-term memory, leading to the very common feeling of "hitting a wall you can't climb up" at some future point.
		- Re-reading and highlighting *feel* like they produce results but actually produce very little memorization or understanding.
			- During REM sleep your brain will throw away the information reviewed by re-reading and highlighting because this information is noisy.
			- You need to perform other activities while re-reading, such as forced recall and focused practice.
	- ## Science Says...
		- Spaced Repition
			- Practice over multiple days to really remember a topic. Repeat concepts you feel confident about **and** concepts that are brand new, easily forgotten, or are challenging.
			- Continue to practice questions from previous units, especially in a subject like math where later units build upon earlier units.
		- Forced Recall
			- Take at least 2 minutes each day to perform the activity:
				- >>Write down everything you know about $x$ topics need to be remembered or understood.
			- The act of forcing yourself to remember or recall a concept actually stores a memory in your brain for longer. Think of this task like **strengthening** the connections your brain is forming to remember or understand concepts.
		- Focused Practice
			- Select questions to practice and complete from start to finish with your best abilities shown in knowledge, thinking, communication, and application.
		- REM Sleep
			- A sleep of at least 6-8 hours every night is required by teenagers to get enough REM sleep where your brain stores its most important information for long-term and trashes the unnecessary information.
	- ## Examples
	- ## Pro-tips
		- Always get a good night's sleep before a test. Always eat breakfast the morning of a test day.
		- Always keep a calendar and know when the next test will be so you can prepare days before you write it.
		- Always practice with the calculator you will use. Learn your calculator well, it is a tool you need to practice.
		- Always show thinking, even if you think it could be wrong. Don't erase unless you will replace; just cross out lightly.
