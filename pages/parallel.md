- #definition Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope or direction. ==[Coincident]([[coincident]])== lines are also parallel.
- #MTH1W Two lines are parallel if and only if their slopes are equal. #eg $$y=3x$$ is parallel to $$y=3x-5$$.
- #MCV4U Two lines are parallel if and only if their direction vectors are scalar multiples of one another. ##eg Given $$t,k\in\R$$ then $$\vec{v}=(1,3)t$$ and $$\vec{v}=(6,2)k-(0,5)$$
