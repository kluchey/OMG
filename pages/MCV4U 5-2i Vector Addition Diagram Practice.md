- # This Practice Builds
	- Complete each problem in the order given.
	  ---
	- Draw diagrams for these scenarios.
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- An airplane, $$\vec{p}$$, is flying and there is wind, $$\vec{w}$$. The airplane wants to travel to a location $$[\text{N}8^\circ E]$$ of where it is currently located. Also draw the resultant, $$\vec{r}$$.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- Solution.
				- Answers may vary since $\vec{p}$ and $\vec{w}$ do not have defined directions. Can you draw this diagram in
		- A person, $$\vec{p}$$, is swimming and there is a current, $$\vec{c}$$. The person wants to travel to a location $$[\text{N}30^\circ E]$$ of where they are currently located. Also draw the resultant, $$\vec{r}$$.
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		- A person, $$\vec{p}$$, is swimming and there is a current, $$\vec{c}$$. The person's position is $$[\text{N}40^\circ E]$$ from where their destination is located. Also draw the resultant, $$\vec{r}$$.
