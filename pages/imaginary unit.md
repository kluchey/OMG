- #definition In some situations, we run into a problem like $\sqrt{-4}$ or similar. In high school, we say we cannot take the square root of a negative number but this is one of many [[rules that expire]] or a [[black box]].
- #MHF4U $\sqrt{-1}$ is not possible but some quadratic equations like $x^2+1=0$
