  Today we begin Unit 4:  Mathematical Modelling and will learn to describe inequalities using our knowledge of Linear Relations.

- ## Preparing for EQAO #.v-self-border
	- Here is a question posed on an EQAO practice test. What do you understand about it? What do not notice that is familiar? What do you notice that is not familiar?
		- Which inequality corresponds to this graph? #.v-border-children 
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  ![image.png](../assets/image_1748372403293_0.png){:height 364, :width 382}
			- $2x-y\leq-2$
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- $2x+y\le-2$
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- $x-2y\le-2$
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- $x+2y\le-2$
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ## Action #.v-self-border
	- An ==[[inequality]]== is a `True` or `False` statement using numbers.
		- Examples: Which of the following statements are `True`?
			- $3>4$
			- $4<3$
			- $3<4$
			- $3\leq3$
			- $3<3$
			- $3\leq-3$
			- $-3<3$
		- When we introduce variables, we begin asking questions. Here is an example, can you make up new questions to match the ==[[subsequent]]== inequalities?
			- #eg $x<3$ is like the question "What numbers are less than 3"?
			- $y>10$
			- $n<-3$
			- $k>-5$
