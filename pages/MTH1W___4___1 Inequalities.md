  Today we begin Unit 4:  Mathematical Modelling and will learn to describe inequalities using our knowledge of Linear Relations.

- ## Preparing for EQAO #.v-self-border
	- Here is a question posed on an #EQAO practice test. What do you understand about it? What do not notice that is familiar? What do you notice that is not familiar?
		- Which inequality corresponds to this graph? #.v-border-children 
		  logseq.order-list-type:: number
		  ![image.png](../assets/image_1748372403293_0.png){:height 364, :width 382}
			- $2x-y\leq-2$
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- $2x+y\le-2$
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- $x-2y\le-2$
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
			- $x+2y\le-2$
			  logseq.order-list-type:: number
- ## Warm Up #.v-self-border
	- An ==[[inequality]]== is a `True` or `False` statement using numbers.
		- Examples: Which of the following statements are `True`?
			- $3>4$
			- $4<3$
			- $3<4$
			- $3\leq3$
			- $3<3$
			- $3\leq-3$
			- $-3<3$
	- When we introduce variables, we begin asking questions where the answers are `True` or `False` Here is an example, can you make up new questions to match the ==[[subsequent]]== inequalities?
		- #eg $x<3$ is like the question "What numbers are less than 3"? The answer $x=2$ is `True` while the $x=4$ is `False`.
		- $y>10$
		- $n<-3$
		- $k>-5$
	- We can also match these questions to our number line. Here is an example, can you draw number lines for the rest?
		- #eg An open circle means it does not equal 2. So $x>2$ has this picture:
		  ![image.png](../assets/image_1748373147068_0.png)
		- $y\geq10$
		- $n<-3$
		- $k\geq-5$
		- Can you work backwards from the number line to write the inequality?

- ## Lesson #.v-self-border
	- We want to learn about these types of inequalities:
		- $y>2x+3$
		- **Strategy:** Graph the line $y=2x+3$.
		  collapsed:: true
			- <iframe src = "https://www.desmos.com/calculator/4brddn7vio" style="height: 400px; width: 100%" ></iframe>
		- We can ask the question, like in the warm up, "What are the y-values greater than the line $2x+3$? Can you identify the ==[[region]]== of the graph this question is creating?
			- *Solution.*
			  collapsed:: true
				- <iframe src = "https://www.desmos.com/calculator/f01d8fn3hi" style="height: 400px; width: 100%" ></iframe>
	- But this still isn't the EQAO Question! What can we do with $$$2x-y\leq-2$$$ and the other answers?
		- We can guess points. We can try points inside the region, on the line, and outside the region.
		- Or, we can use reasoning:  our goal is to get $y<line$ or $y>line$.
		- $$ \begin{align*}
		  2x - y &< -2 \\
		  2x &< -2 + y \\
		  2x +2 &< y
		  \end{align*} $$
		- Can we now see why a. is not the answer to the EQAO question?
	- Exit Ticket:
		- Draw the region of the graph defined by $y<4x-5$.
		- Draw the region of the graph defined by $-4x-2y>6$.
