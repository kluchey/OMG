  This is a fairly exhaustive list of common high school math errors named and categorized by the mathematical rule they break or misinterpret. Study this list well but make a personalized list for yourself.

- ## Dropping a Negative
	- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
	  Award Winner!  This error is the **most common** to make in high school.

	- #eg Imagine yourself calculating slope using the formula $m=\frac{y_2-y_1}{x_2-x_1}$:
		- $$ \begin{align}
		  m &= \frac{3-(-3)}{2-1} \\
		  &= \frac{0}{1}
		  \end{align} $$
		- Did you just see it? $3-(-3) = 3+3 = 6$ not $0$. By not showing the intermediary step of $3+3$ this student has *dropped a negative*.
	- To reliably avoid this error, always show intermediary steps, even in your practice, so you can look back at **every. single. calculation.** you have made during your process.
- ## Copy Error
	- #+BEGIN_IMPORTANT
	  Award Winner! This error is the **silliest** and *feels bad*. #oof
	  #+END_IMPORTANT
	- #eg A test has the formula $A=\frac{1}{2}\cdot l\cdot w$ for the Area of a Triangle. When a student goes to copy this formula for use in their math, this is what they write:
		- $$ \begin{align}
		  A &= l\cdot w
		  \end{align} $$
	- To reliably avoid this error, always re-read the statement of a problem before you begin solving and after you have finished each step.
- ## Spilling the t
	- #eg #MCV4U A symmetric equation is given by $\frac{x-2}{3}=\frac{y-1}{4}$ and a student is asked to write the parametric equations. Either:
		- The student does not know how, claiming there is no $y
