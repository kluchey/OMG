- # OMG Hello 👋 #.v-self-border
	- **Welcome** to Mr. Cluchey's Ontario Math Graph. Students, Parents, and Teachers are welcome to use or adapt these self-directed lessons to help your Ontario student learn mathematics.
	- "**Explain it like I'm a Grade 9**" I write this resource by assuming the reader has or is developing a [Grade 9]([[MTH1W]]) understanding of math. Later years in high school are built up from Grade 9.
	- My **goal** for this resource is a useful reference, effective learning tool, and [[Study Guide]]. I'm looking to preserve a set of stories and math problems from an Ontario classroom #culture.
