- # OMG Hello
	- Welcome to Mr. Cluchey's Ontario Math Graph. Students, Parents, and Teachers are welcome to use or adapt these self-directed lessons to help your Ontario student learn mathematics.
	- I hope this resource is useful for my students to be able to learn effective study techniques, such as ==[active recall]([[Study Guide]])== and ==[focused practice]([[Study Guide]])== of our in-school lessons, and as a reference and learning tool used when absent from class.
