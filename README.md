- # OMG Hello
	- >>Welcome to Mr. Cluchey's ***O*ntario *M*ath *G*raph**. Students, Parents, and Teachers are welcome to use or adapt these self-directed lessons to help your Ontario student learn mathematics.
	- I hope this resource is useful for my students to be able to learn effective study techniques, such as *active recall* and **focused practice** of our in-school lessons, and as a reference and learning tool used when absent from class.
	- This is an attempt at putting together a personal knowledge manager of essential skills and  lessons in Ontario math courses. This *graph* illustrates how grades and courses connect together visually so that (hopefully) anyone can view and understand the importance of each skill. Additionally, I hope this graph will eventually be helpful for decision making:
		- Which topics *can* be cut, which need to stay?
		- Where can I find resources quickly to teach a lesson? This database is searchable.
		- I'm a student - where can I go to find information about skills I need to be successful?
		- I'm a teacher - how can I stay organized and ensure my students have learned enough to progress a year in their learning?
		- I'm a parent/guardian - what is my child learning? I need resources they can use to learn together or independently
