# Ontario Math Graph
	- Aurhor k.cluchey.ca
- ## Hello World!
	- This is an attempt at putting together a personal knowledge manager of essential skills in Ontario math courses. This *graph* illustrates how grades and courses connect together visually so that (hopefully) anyone can view and understand the importance of each skill. Additionally, I hope this graph will eventually be helpful for decision making:
		- Which topics *can* be cut, which need to stay?
		- Where can I find resources quickly to teach a lesson? This database is searchable.
		- I'm a student - where can I go to find information about skills I need to be successful?
		- I'm a teacher - how can I stay organized and ensure my students have learned enough to progress a year in their learning?
