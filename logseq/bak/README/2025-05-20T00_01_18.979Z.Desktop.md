# Ontario Math Graph

by k.cluchey
## Hello World!

This is an attempt at putting together a graph (vertices connected by edges) of essential skills to teach math as an Ontario Teacher. The graph illustrates how grades and courses connect together visually so that (hopefully) anyone can view and understand the importance of each skill. Additionally, I hope this graph will eventually be helpful for decision making:

*  Which topics *can* be cut, which need to stay?
*  Where can I find resources quickly to teach a lesson? This database is searchable.
*  I'm a student - where can I go to find information about skills I need to be successful?
*  I'm a teacher - how can I stay organized and ensure my students have learned enough to progress to post-secondary?
