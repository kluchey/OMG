- Objective:  Students will review three key skills that will continue to be developed throughout all units of Grade 9 Mathematics.
	- Representing Quantities
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Solving for an Unknown
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Computational Thinking
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number

- Story:  You've been assigned a robot assistant to train and right now it only knows how to follow the literal meaning of your instructions. You didn't know going to high school would mean you'd have this huge responsibility to train a robot how to think, yet here you are, and you're *hungry*. You decide to ask the robot to make you a PB&J Sandwich (or a school safe SB&J). What are the instructions you give the robot?
	- How successfully do you think the robot will follow your instructions? Can you modify your instructions so they can be understood by the robot?
	- Watch the following video. What did the kids not expect to happen? Why does this unexpected behaviour happen? What can be done to fix the unexpected behavior? Who in the video is the "robot" and what do you think "literal" means used earlier in this lesson?

- Tasks:  This is just the start of the robot's training. You still need to teach it to move around and then you have also decided it should learn to do some tasks around your home to make your life easier.
	- Lesson:  [How do I navigate?]([[MTH1W 0-2 Coordinates]])
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Practice:  Writing clear instructions
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Lesson:  How do I measure?
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Practice:  Direction, Area, and Fraction
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Lesson:  How do I reason, organize, and remember?
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Practice:  Solving for an unknown
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number
	- Practice:  Computational steps
	  logseq.order-list-type:: number

- When you are finished each task you will then write your summary test. These are the skills, with possible responses, you should be able to explain in your own words and apply to new situations.
