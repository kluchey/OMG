- Story:  You've been assigned a robot assistant to train and right now it only knows how to follow the literal meaning of your instructions. You didn't know going to high school would mean you'd have this huge responsibility to train a robot how to think, yet here you are, and you're *hungry*. You decide to ask the robot to make you a PB&J Sandwich (or a school safe SB&J). What are the instructions you give the robot?
	- How successfully do you think the robot will follow your instructions? Can you modify your instructions so they can be understood by the robot?
	- Watch the following video. What did the kids not expect to happen? Why does this unexpected behaviour happen? What can be done to fix the unexpected behavior?
