# Definition

A **factor** is a whole number that divides another number so that the [[Quotient]] is also a whole number.

## Example

$$(4)(5)=20$$
$4$ and $5$ are both factors of 20 but are not the only factors of 20. Here are all the positive factors of 20:
$$1,2,4,5,10,20$$
Please note that factors come in *pairs*, i.e. $1\times20=20$ means $1$ and $20$ are paired together.
