# Student Success

## The Definition

Success is loosely defined in *Growing Success*. A statement is made in the introduction that *success* is related to the proud Canadian achievement of Ontario students on global standardized testing (p. 1, 2010). It is also said that students are unique and must achieve success according to their own "interests, abilities, and goals" (OME, p. 1, 2010).

## Evaluation Practices

There are three ways to evaluate:  Averages (including weighted), on a "Curve" via a Quartile method of Ranking, and what is called Mastery.

### Weighted Averages

### Normal Curve Ranking

### Mastery
