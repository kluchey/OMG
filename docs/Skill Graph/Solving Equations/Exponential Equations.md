# How to Solve an Exponential Equation

## Big Idea


## Method 1:  Estimation


## Method 2:  Common Base


## Method 3:  Logarithms

!!! Note
	The curriculum is old (~two decades) and by the rule of the curriculum, Grade 11s **do not learn logarithms** and so officially cannot solve Exponential Equations using this method. **Students be aware:  you may be penalized for solving using Logarithms since it may not be taught to you.**  A better rule:  If any method is **not** taught directly in the course or in a prerequisite, then it is **not acceptable** to use the method.  Math Courses are collections of methods and teachers or students should not go out of the *scope* of a course unless explicitly told to because it creates confusion about what students should know and teachers should expect students to know.


## Problem Set

1. Use the method of estimation to solve for x in the equation:  $$ 2^x=100 $$
2. Use the method of a common base to solve for $x$ in the equation: $$ 3^{2x}=27 $$
3. (Grade 12 Only) Use the method of a logarithm to solve for $x$ in the equation:  $$ 10^{3x-1}=2024 $$
4. Use any method to solve for $x$ in the equation: $$ \frac{1}{49}=7^{x-1} $$
5. Solve for x in the equation $$ 5^{x+2}+5^x=120 $$Hint:  There are no exponential laws that allow us to add exponents of the same base. However, this equation reminds me of the unrelated quadratic expression $5x^2 + 5x$ that can be common factored as $5x(x+1)$.
