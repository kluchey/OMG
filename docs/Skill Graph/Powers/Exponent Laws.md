# Exponent Laws

Let $a,b,n$ be any two real numbers and $x,y$ be any two positive real numbers. The exponent laws are:

### Product of Powers

$$ x^a\cdot x^b = x^{a+b} $$

Observe:  These powers have the same base. There is no Product of Powers law for powers with unique bases. $x^ay^b\neq (xy)^{a+b}$.

Examples:
1. $4^3\cdot 4^2 = 4^{3+2}=4^5$
2. $(-5)^{10}\cdot (-10)^{50} = (-10)^{60}$

Non-Examples:  These examples look like opportunities to use an the Product of Powers but doing so would cause an error.
1. Unique Bases:  $5^2 \cdot 4^5$
2. Unique Bases:  $x^3 \cdot y^{-1}$
### Quotient of Powers
