## Description

Design or replicate an image on Desmos using only linear equations and linear inequalities.

You will need a Desmos Account for this project to save your work.

## Success Criteria
 
1. You have creative freedom to either:  recreate an image or design your own using Desmos. If you do not want creative freedom, please make or recreate a flag. Your flag or your image must have at least one of each:  diagonal, horizontal, and vertical lines.
2. Your art must only contain linear equations, linear inequalities, and points. You this part before you begin working on Desmos.
  
### What to Submit:

1. A proposal. One page with an image you have drafted onto graph paper. Note: your image can contain only straight lines or points styled using the tools in Desmos (dashed lines, colours, etc). The more lines you have, the more time you will need to put into find an equation for every line.
2. A link to your Desmos completed Linear Art Project. **Be sure to save your project regularly so work is not lost.**
3. A write up answering the three required reflection questions that prove you can find equations and inequalities.
