# Storytelling Project

## Description

Select one topic from the [[Courses/MTH1W/Storytelling Project/index#Topic List|Topic List]] below or create your own topic. *It is always best to select a topic that sounds interesting to you. There are no "difficult" topics.*  Everyone must select a [[../../../Resources/Definitions/Unique|unique]] topic. Sign up with your topic on Google Classroom.

You will research a ***number concept***, an ***algebraic concept***, a ***geometric concept***, or a ***measurement system*** to tell a story about its development and use in a **specific culture or community**, and describe its **relevance** in connection to a career or our daily experiences.

## Success Criteria

To meet the requirements of this project you will include all of the following within a **5-minute presentation**:

1. A visual component to your story that can be digitally recorded and shared.
!!! example
	A poster, slideshow, video, physical manipulative, scrapbook, vision board, collage, …
2. A part of your story will explain or show how your topic is related to a specific culture or community in the past or present.
3. A part of your story will explain or show how your topic is connected to our present day understanding of the world or a career. 
4. A part of your story will explain or show a math problem, understandable by Grade 9s, related to your topic. 
5. A Bibliography in MLA or APA Formatting
	1. Use [https://zbib.org/](https://zbib.org/), or
	2. [NoodleTools](https://my.noodletools.com/logon/gapps/landing/ugcloud.ca) (UGDSB)
	3. You need three sources.
!!! note
	Wikipedia is often a good resource to start your research but should not be your only source of information.
