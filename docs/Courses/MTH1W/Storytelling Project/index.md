# Storytelling Project

!!! quote
	“It is impossible to be a mathematician without being a poet in soul.” - [Sofia Kovalevskaya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sofya_Kovalevskaya)

## Description

Select one topic from the [[Courses/MTH1W/Storytelling Project/index#Topic List|Topic List]] below or create your own topic. *It is always best to select a topic that sounds interesting to you. There are no "difficult" topics.* Each student is required to select a [[../../../Resources/Definitions/Unique|unique]] topic so that no two students have the same topic. Sign up for a topic with your teacher.

You will research a ***number concept***, an ***algebraic concept***, a ***geometric concept***, or a ***measurement system*** to tell a story about its development and use in a **specific culture or community**, and describe its **relevance** by making connections to a career, school subject, or our daily experiences.

To see examples of this project, [[examples|click here]].
## Success Criteria

To meet the requirements of this project you will include all of the following within a **5-minute presentation**. The date of your presentation will be decided in class.

1. A visual component to your story that can be digitally recorded and shared.
!!! example
	Digital Creations:  Posters, slideshows, recorded videos, audio clips, websites, multimedia, ...
	Physical Creations:  Scrapbook, vision board, collage, paper maches, 3D prints, ...
2. One part of your story will explain or show a *deep connection* to a specific culture or community in the present or past. Your deep connection should help others learn about the people of the culture or community in your topic.
3. One part of your story will explain or show a *deep connection* to a school subject, a career, or a daily experience in which you are interested. 
4. One part of your story will explain or show a math problem, understandable by Grade 9s, related to your topic.
5. A Bibliography in MLA or APA Formatting
	1. Use [https://zbib.org/](https://zbib.org/), or
	2. [NoodleTools](https://my.noodletools.com/logon/gapps/landing/ugcloud.ca) (UGDSB)
	3. You need three sources.
!!! note
	Wikipedia is often a good resource to start your research but should not be your only source of information.
