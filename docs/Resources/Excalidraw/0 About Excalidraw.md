# Excalidraw

Excalidraw is an excellent mind-mapping and visual diagramming tools put to use on this site to create embedded SVG images and interactive notes.  The project is open source.

## iFrame Embeddings

HTML iFrame elements can be used to embed Excalidraw documents. Excalidraw files are saved locally in the browser and so this means refreshing the page with embedded iFrame excalidraw documents results in deletion warnings thrown by Excalidraw. For this reason, all excalidraw files should be embedded as SVG instead unless interactivity is necessary. See example below (refresh page to see warning:  click "Replace my content").

This iFrame was embedded on March 8, 2024. Note to self:  do Excalidraw share links expire?
