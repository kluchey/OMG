# Definition

See Integer. A whole number is an Integer but may also refer to a Natural Number.

## Example

$$4$$
The number four is a whole number.

## Non-Example

$$4.25$$
The number 4.25 is not an Integer, so it is not a whole number. It contains a fractional part, $0.25$, meaning it is no longer whole.
