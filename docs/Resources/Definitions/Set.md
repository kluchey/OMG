# Definition

A set is a group of mathematical objects (often numbers but does not need to be numbers).

Here are the most commonly used sets in mathematics:

### Natural Numbers
$$\mathbb{N}=\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...\}$$
Computer Scientists and related mathematical fields include 0 in the set of Natural Numbers as well.

### Integers
$$\mathbb{Z}=\{..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}$$
### Rational Numbers
$$\mathbb{Q}=\{\frac{1}{1}, \frac{-1}{1}, \frac{1}{2}, \frac{-1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{-1}{3}, \frac{2}{3}, ...\}$$
A rational number is defined as the division between two integers. So $\frac{\pi}{2}$ is not a rational number because $\pi$ is not an integer.
### Real Numbers
$$\mathbb{R}$$
Real numbers are not possible to list but include such hits as $\pi$ or $e$ or $\sqrt{2}$ where these were not possible to write as Rational Numbers. You can think of Real numbers as the list of "all numbers on a number line".
## Example

See above. As well, here are some  other examples:

### The Set of Binary Numbers
$$\{0,1\} \text{ or } \{\text{True}, \text{ False}\}$$
This set, unlike the above examples, is [[Infinite|finite]] in size. This means that the set has a size that we can describe as a Natural Number. This particular set has the size 2.

### The Set of Suits in a Deck of Cards
$$\{\heartsuit,\diamondsuit,\clubsuit,\spadesuit\}$$
