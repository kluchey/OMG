# Consecutive

## Definition

Two numbers are consecutive if they appear in beside each other in a [[Sequence|sequence]]. The most common use of consecutive refers to numbers that appear in the Natural order:  $$ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... $$

## Example

In the above definition, 1 is consecutive to 2 and 0. 

2 is consecutive to 1 and 3.

1 is **not** consecutive to 3 but we can say "1, 2, and 3" are consecutive numbers.

Another example is this:  $2, 4, 6, 8, ...$ in which we would say "2, 4, and 6" are consecutive **even** numbers. This just means 2, 4, and 6 appear beside each other in the [[Sequence|sequence]] of even numbers.
